      <h2>My Love Letter</h2>
      <p>
        Petronela,  
        From the moment we started talking, you became a piece of my day I can't live without. Even with the distance, you make me feel close, seen, and cared for.  
        I made this not just to surprise you, but because I wanted to create something real — like what I feel for you.  
        Thank you for being here, for trusting me, for smiling when I need it most.  
        I'm always thinking of you.  
        <br />— Your Yassine
